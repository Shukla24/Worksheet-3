"13","Clustering is useful for exploring data. If there are many cases and no obvious groupings, clustering algorithms can be used to find natural groupings. Clustering can also serve as a useful data-preprocessing step to identify homogeneous groups on which to build supervised models.During unsupervised learning we do cluster analysis (like K-Means) to bin the data to a number of clusters."
"14","For profiling we use using the K-means clustering technique: it handles large dataset very well and iterates rapidly to stable solutions.using the K-means clustering technique: it handles large dataset very well and iterates rapidly to stable solutions.Then, I build a function to calculate kmeans for any number of centres and create a nested tibble to house all the model output."
"15","K-means clustering algorithm can be significantly improved by using a better initialization technique, and by repeating (re-starting) the algorithm. When the data has overlapping clusters, k-means can improve the results of the initialization technique."

"10","he Bayes’ theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event.t is considered the foundation of the special statistical inference approach called the Bayes’ inference."
"11","A Z-score is a numerical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean.Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean."
"12","A t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest, or whether two groups are different from one another"
"13","In statistics, a percentile (or a centile) is a score below which a given percentage of scores in its frequency distribution fall (exclusive definition) or a score at or below which a given percentage fall (inclusive definition). ... The percentile (or percentile score) and the percentile rank are related terms."
"14","Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an analysis tool used in statistics that splits an observed aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts: systematic factors and random factors. The systematic factors have a statistical influence on the given data set, while the random factors do not. Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence that independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression study."
"15","An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant. In other words, they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis. Basically, you're testing groups to see if there's a difference between them."
